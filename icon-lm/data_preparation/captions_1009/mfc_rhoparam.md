To solve the $\inf_{\rho, m}\int \frac{10m^2}{\rho} dx dt + \int g(x)\rho(1,x) dx$, by considering the equation $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$, the initial density function is $\rho_0(0), \rho_0(0.1), ..., \rho_0(0.9)$ = [\rho_0].
In the mean field control problem, known density [\rho_0] is used in the PDE $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$ over the lifetime, $t \in [0,1]$.
Delving into the mean field control problem with parameters defined as: $\inf_{\rho, m}\iint \frac{10m^2}{\rho} dx dt + \int g(x)\rho(1,x) dx$, subject to $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$, for $t \in [0,1], x \in [0,1]$, with periodic spatial boundary condition, and $\rho_0(0), \rho_0(0.1), ..., \rho_0(0.9)$ = [\rho_0].
For a mean field control problem, we evaluate $\inf_{\rho, m}\int \frac{10m^2}{\rho} dx dt + \int g(x) * \rho(1,x) dx$ under conditions $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$, for $t \in [0,1]$ and $x \in [0,1]$, with periodic spatial boundary conditions and initial density that satisfies $\rho_0(0), \rho_0(0.1), ..., \rho_0(0.9)$ = [\rho_0].
Consider a mean field control problem with the density function represented by $\rho(t,x)$ and known values [\rho_0], thriving in the PDE environment defined by $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$.
Unpacking the minimum control problem $\inf_{\rho, m}\iint \frac{10m^2}{\rho} dx dt + \int g(x)\rho(1,x) dx$ subject to $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$ for $t \in [0,1], x \in [0,1]$, with periodic spatial boundary condition, and the conditions $\rho_0(0), \rho_0(0.1), ..., \rho_0(0.9)$ = [\rho_0].
We are asked to solve for $\inf_{\rho, m}\int \frac{10m^2}{\rho} dx dt + \int g(x)\rho(1,x) dx$, under the constraint $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$ and a defined initial distribution $\rho_0(0), \rho_0(0.1), ..., \rho_0(0.9) = $ [\rho_0] .
In a mean field control problem, the known density function [\rho_0] is subject to the governing PDE $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$.
Mean field control problem characterized by the density function $\rho(t, x)$ with known values [\rho_0] and terminal cost $\int g(x)\rho(1,x)dx$.
We have segregation of $\inf_{\rho, m}\int \frac{10m^2}{\rho} dx dt + \int g(x)\rho(1,x) dx$ and $\partial_t \rho(t,x) + \nabla_x m(t,x) = 0.02 \Delta_x \rho(t,x)$ for $t \in [0,1], x \in [0,1]$ with $\rho_0(0), \rho_0(0.1), ..., \rho_0(0.9)$ = [\rho_0].

Mean field control problem's dynamics are determined with an associated density function having initial values $\rho_0(0), \rho_0(0.1), ..., \rho_0(0.9)$ = [\rho_0] and the governing optimisation equations.
