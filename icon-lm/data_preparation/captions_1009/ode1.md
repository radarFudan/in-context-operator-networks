In the ODE $\frac{du(t)}{dt} = [0.001]* c(t) + [0.002]$, the change in $u(t)$ over time is dictated by parameters $a=[0.001]$, $b=[0.002]$.
Given the ODE $\frac{du(t)}{dt} = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$, precisely, $a$ has a value of $[0.001]$ and $b$ has a value of $[0.002]$.
For $u(t)$, the change over a period of time can be modeled by the equation $du/dt = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$.
The ODE with $u$ as an evolving function and parameters $a=[0.001]$, $b=[0.002]$ is $du/dt = [0.001]* c(t) + [0.002]$.
$du(t)/dt = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$ is an ODE describing the evolution of the state variable $u$ with respect to control variable $c$.
The equation $du(t)/dt = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$ is a representation of the ordinary differential equation, where $a = [0.001]$ and $b = [0.002]$.
For the ODE $du(t)/dt = [0.001]*c(t) + [0.002]$, control variable $c(t)$ influences $u(t)$ with parameters $a=[0.001]$, $b=[0.002]$.
The ordinary differential equation given by $du(t)/dt = [0.001] c(t) + [0.002]$ represents the rate of change of state variable $u$, where $c(t)$ is the control and constants $a=[0.001]$, $b=[0.002]$.
Given $a = [0.001]$ and $b = [0.002]$, the rate of change of $u$ over time is modeled by $du/dt = a \cdot c(t) + b$.
State variable $u$ evolves over time as dictated by the ODE $du(t)/dt = [0.001]*c(t) + [0.002]$.
The ordinary differential equation is $\frac{du(t)}{dt} = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$, where $a = [0.001]$ and $b = [0.002]$.
The differential equation $du(t)/dt = [0.001] c(t) + [0.002]$ states that the rate of change of $u(t)$ is linearly dependent on the control variable $c(t)$, with coefficients $a = [0.001]$, $b = [0.002]$.
In the dynamical system, state variable $u$ changes with time according to $du/dt = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$, where $c$ is the control variable.
Our ODE model, with given parameters $a = [0.001]$ and $b = [0.002]$, becomes $du(t) / dt = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$.
The system with state variable $u$ and control variable $c$ evolves according to $du/dt = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$.
The ordinary differential equation describing the system is given as $du(t)/dt = [0.001] \cdot c(t) + [0.002]$.
