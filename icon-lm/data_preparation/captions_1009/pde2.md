For $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $coeff_{ul} = [0.003]$, and $coeff_{ur} = [0.004]$, the PDE amounts to $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, with $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The equation becomes explicit when specified as $-[0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with the restrictions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The behavior of $u(x)$ and $c(x)$ can be portrayed by $- [0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$. We also find $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$ from the boundary conditions.
The boundary conditions at $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$ define this PDE solution: $-[0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$.
The PDE $- [0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ shows the impact of $c(x)$ on $u$, considering $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
In this model, the PDE $- [0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, along with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$, encapsulates the system's dynamics.
The equation $- [0.001] * \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) * u = [0.002]$ given, bounded by the conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Partial differential equation with parameters given: $-\lambda \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, alongside the boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
With $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $coeff_ul = [0.003]$, and $coeff_ur = [0.004]$, we have the equation $-[0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The specific situation where $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$ results in the PDE $-[0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with boundaries $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The variables in our equation are given values, where $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $coeff_ul = [0.003]$, and $coeff_ur = [0.004]$. This implies that our differential equation becomes $-[0.001] d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, and the boundary conditions are $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The PDE for the system is $- [0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
$-\lambda d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) * u = a$ with $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, and boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$ distinctly describes the concept of the equation.
Here, we have the equation $-[0.001] d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with parameters $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $coeff_ul = [0.003]$, and $coeff_ur = [0.004]$ and the accompanying boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The PDE, given all specified values for the parameters, can be expressed as $-[0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ bounded by conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The PDE is defined as $-[0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, paired with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The partial differential equation $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ has defined boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Equation $- [0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ describes the system dynamics, with boundary conditions defined as $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The equation $-[0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ is accompanied by boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
When $\lambda = [0.001]$, the boundary conditions are $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$, and we have $-[0.001]*d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$.
With the parameters $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $coeff_{ul} = [0.003]$, and $coeff_{ur} = [0.004]$, the PDE is written as $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, with $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Given $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $u(0) = [0.003]$, and $u(1) = [0.004]$, our model rests on the PDE $- [0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$.
The modeled PDE is $- [0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, taken with the boundary condition at $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
In this mathematical model, relevant parameters are $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $u(0) = [0.003]$, and $u(1) = [0.004]$. These are introduced in the PDE $- [0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$.
Given the specific parameter $\lambda = [0.001]$, the PDE becomes $-[0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
$- [0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ is the PDE modeling the system. We enforce the boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Given the parameters are $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $coeff_{ul} = [0.003]$, and $coeff_{ur} = [0.004]$, the equation $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, is bounded by the conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Negative [0.001] times the second-order derivative of the function $u(x)$ plus the product of $c(x)$ and $u(x)$ is set equal to [0.002], with the boundary conditions defined as $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Using the PDE $- [0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ we depict the system's evolution, with boundary values $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The PDE governing the system is $- [0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, with boundary conditions stipulating $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Provided with specifics, the equation becomes $-[0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with boundaries $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The PDE defined by the equation $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ is subject to the boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Given the differential equation $-[0.001]*\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) * u = [0.002]$, with the initial condition set as $u(0) = [0.003]$ and the boundary condition set as $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The dependence of $u(x)$ on $c(x)$ is defined by the PDE $- [0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Given is the equation $- [0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) * u = [0.002]$, with the boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
$-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ are the boundary conditions given as $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The differential equation $-\lambda * \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = a$ interprets the influence of $c(x)$ on $u$ with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$, where $\lambda = [0.001]$, and $a = [0.002]$.
Our model PDE is given by the equation $- [0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, which has the boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Given is a PDE $- [0.001] * \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) * u = [0.002]$ with boundary values specified as $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Analyzing the PDE $- [0.001] * \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) * u = [0.002]$, we impose the boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The PDE $- [0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$, and $u(1) = [0.004]$, explains how $u(x)$ and $c(x)$ are correlated.
By insertion of provided parameters, the equation becomes $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, with boundary terms $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Assuming $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $coeff_{ul} = [0.003]$ and $coeff_{ur} = [0.004]$, the PDE is given as $-[0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The specific values $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $u(0) = [0.003]$, and $u(1) = [0.004]$ give us $-[0.001] \times d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \times u = [0.002]$ as our governing PDE.
The model interfaces with the PDE $- [0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, and with boundaries $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Using prescribed parameter values $\lambda = [0.001]$, $a = [0.002]$, $coeff_{ul} = [0.003]$, and $coeff_{ur} = [0.004]$, the partial differential equation becomes $-[0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ and has boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The representation of the interplay of $u(x)$ and $c(x)$ via a linear reaction is given by $- [0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, where boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$, and $u(1) = [0.004]$ are considered.
The dynamics of the system are captured by the PDE $- [0.001] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with boundary conditions set to be $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
The PDE $- [0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$ with boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$ is a concrete representation of how $u(x)$ and $c(x)$ are modified.
The boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$ allow us to solve the PDE $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$.
Our specific case yields the equation $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, with $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Under the defined parameters, the PDE is expressed as $-[0.001] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) \cdot u = [0.002]$, with $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$.
Given the boundary conditions $u(0) = [0.003]$ and $u(1) = [0.004]$, our equation is $- [0.001] * d^2u/dx^2 + c(x) * u = [0.002]$.
