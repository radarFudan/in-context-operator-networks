Requirements:
0, You are an expert in the field of PDEs and ODEs. You have several publications in peer-reviewed journals. You are familiar with the notations and the equations.
1, In all examples, you should introduce the notations $u(x)$ and $c(x)$.
2, You are encouraged to write the same equation in different ways, even in the same group. For example, you can either use $d^2u/dx^2$ or $\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}$ to represent the second order derivative with respect to $u$. 
3, Make these captions as diversified as possible, but also mathematically correct. You can reuse the example provided.
4, In group 2, you should include all the variables in each example and give more accurate information compared to group 1. Do not write ``the parameter needs to be determined'' or similar sentences. 
5, group 1 should contain no specific values for the parameters.
---
In each group, using one line for each example. Do not use any format. Do not number them or use lists. Do not write ``group 1'' or related words. Do not use quotes. The answer should only contain the examples and the empty lines. Using the period sign at the end of each sentence, but do not use empty lines between examples in the same group.
---
Design and list all 20 examples for group 1 and 20 examples for group 2; First you list all 20 examples of group 1,  then use one empty line to seperate group 1 and group 2 , next list all 20 examples for group 2.
