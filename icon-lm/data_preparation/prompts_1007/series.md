Generate captions for an ordinary differential equation (ODE).

Here are some example captions:
Harmonic oscillator with a damped trajectory represented by $u$.
Damped harmonic oscillator with trajectory $u(t)$ and unknown damping coefficient.
The trajectory $u$ is damped harmonic oscillation with the damping coefficient $\gamma = 0.001$.
The motion of $u(t)$ can be represented as $u(t) = A*sin(2*pi/T * t + \eta)*exp(-\gamma*t)$, where $\gamma = 0.001$.

Now please design two groups of captions based on the above examples. Do not use the word "decay" in the human language description. Use $\gamma$ as the notation of the damping coefficient.

In the group 1, you can use human language or tell the form of the equation with parameters, but do not tell the value of the parameters. For example: Harmonic oscillator with a damped trajectory represented by $u$.
Damped harmonic oscillator with trajectory $u(t)$ and unknown damping coefficient.

In the group 2, you should tell the values of the parameter $\gamma$. We give that $\gamma = 0.001$. In the expression, you should specify the parameters values. The following examples are good:
The trajectory $u$ is damped harmonic oscillation with the damping coefficient $\gamma = 0.001$.
The motion of $u(t)$ can be mathematically represented as $A*sin(2*pi/T * t + \eta)*exp(-\gamma*t)$, where $\gamma = 0.001$.
